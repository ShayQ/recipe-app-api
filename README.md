# About
This project is an advanced recipe API that allows you to upload and store some of your favourite recipes from photos and the web.

You can create objects i.e. recipes with titles, price points, cooking times, ingredients and tags like “comfort food”, “vegan” or “dessert”. Think of it as a virtual recipe box.

This is a fully functioning REST API that can handle:
  * User authentication
  * Creating objects
  * Filtering and sorting objects
  * Uploading and viewing images
  * Setup a project with Docker and Docker-Compose
  * Configure Travis-CI to automatically run linting and unit tests
  * Write unit tests using the Django Test Framework
  * Apply best practice principles including Test Driven Development  
  * Handle uploading media files with Django
  * Customize the Django admin
  * Configure a Postgres database

# What I've learned
